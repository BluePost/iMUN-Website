## Security 
Security is central to everything we do at iMUN. Your connection to the iMUN servers is encrypted using secure socket layer technology, and these servers are located in London or Ireland. We only use EU data centers for EU customers, and do not rely on safe harbour for your data. iMUN is also independently verified as secure by Comodo security and McAfee.
## Any event, any load
Using advanced load balancing technology we can handle events from 10 delegates to 10,000 delegates - contact us to find out what makes iMUN so scalable.
## Web
iMUN is entirely web based. There is no need to install clunky software, or battle with internal technology teams over security policies, installing software or letting ips through the firewall. Anyone can access iMUN from anywhere in the world, using any internet connection.
